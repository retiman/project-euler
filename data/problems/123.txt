Let p(n) be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (p(n)-1)^n + (p(n)+1)^n is divided by p(n)^2.

For example, when n = 3, p(3) = 5, and 4^3 + 6^3 = 280 congruent to 5 (mod 25).

The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 109 is 7037.

Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 1010.
