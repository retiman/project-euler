There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, C(5, 3) = 10.

In general,

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: C(23, 10) = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  C(n, r), for 1  n  100, are greater than one-million?
