The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer b, denoted by a↑↑b or ^(b)a, is recursively defined by:

a↑↑1 = a,
a↑↑(k+1) = a^((a↑↑k)).

Thus we have e.g. 3↑↑2 = 3^(3) = 27, hence 3↑↑3 = 3^(27) = 7625597484987 and 3↑↑4 is roughly 10^(3.6383346400240996*10^12).

Find the last 8 digits of 1777↑↑1855.
